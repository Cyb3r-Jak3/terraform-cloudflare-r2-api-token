    # Terraform Cloudflare R2 API Token

    Terraform module to create a Cloudflare API token that have bucket scope permissions.

    Example:
    ```hcl
    module "r2-api-token" {
      source  = "Cyb3r-Jak3/r2-api-token/cloudflare"
      version = "<version>"
      account_id = "<account>"
      buckets = ["bucket-1", "bucket-2"]
      write = false
    }
    ```

    ### Cloudflare provider version support

    5.0 and above uses version 5.0 of the Cloudflare provider.  
    4.1.1 and below uses version 4 of the Cloudflare provider.

    I will continue to support the 4.1.1 version to the best of my ability, but I will not be adding new features to it. I will only add new features to the 5.0 version of the provider.
